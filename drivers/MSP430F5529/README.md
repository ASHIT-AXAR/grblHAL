## MSP430F5529

A GrblHAL driver for the Texas Instruments MSP430F5529 LaunchPad.

I made this driver just to see if it could be done and for now I do not intend to use it myself...

Pin assignments matches the [CNC BoosterPack](https://github.com/terjeio/CNC_Boosterpack) and it uses its onboard EEPROM for configuration storage.

**NOTE:** currently only tested on a LaunchPad where the motor step/dir outputs were connected to LEDs.
