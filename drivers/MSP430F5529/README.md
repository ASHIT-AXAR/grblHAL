## MSP430F5529

A GrblHAL driver for Texas Instruments MSP430F5529 LaunchPad

Pin allocations matches the [CNC BoosterPack](https://github.com/terjeio/CNC_Boosterpack) and it uses its onboard EEPROM for configuration storage.

**NOTE:** currently only tested on a LaunchPad where the motor step/dir outputs were connected to LEDs.
